## 🚀 Project Overview

With rising medical complications and multi-drug usage, the chances of harmful drug interactions have increased significantly. MedCare aims to solve this by building a next-generation healthcare ecosystem that:

- Maintains complete and centralized patient medical history

- Alerts doctors about possible harmful drug interactions

- Suggests safer alternative medications

- Reduces medical errors caused by missing or inaccurate records

- Supports medical research through structured drug-interaction data

- The platform ultimately enhances patient safety, reduces treatment delays, and assists healthcare providers in making informed prescription decisions.
